        You've assembled a crack team for a brand new project:
        a site where paleontologists and other dinosaur scientists
        can send each other important scientific messages, along
        with the usual cat photos.

        Each scientist will need to register to gain access, and
        you - knowing that using BDD will create a better product -
        are writing a registration feature. Fill in the 4 feature
        lines in `registration.feature`.

    question: >
        For the messaging feature, you and the intern (Bob) are in
        a heated debate over how to phrase the business value.
        Which if the following is the *best* business value for the
        message feature:
    explanation: >
        Business value is subjective. But to help, forget about the technology
        and think about the problem that your user role (scientist) wants to
        solve. Both "communicate" and "exchange information and resources"
        are pretty good business values, but I like the second, because it
        contains a few more details about what the scientists actually
        want to do.
    features:
        multiple_choice:
            choices:
                a: In order to type messages and click to send them to scientists.
                b: In order to communicate with other scientists.
                c: In order to exchange information and resources with other scientists.
                d: In order to send cat videos.
            correct: c

# Scenarios

    question: >
        After writing the feature for registration, the whole team
        (even Bob the intern!) is excited about BDD! Let's write the
        first scenario for our feature where we register successfully.
        After some conversation, you basically want it to work like this:

        1. You start on the homepage
        2. You click a link called "Register"
        3. You fill out an "Email" field and a "Password" field
        4. You press a "Register" button
        5. You see some text on the page, like "Hi Dr. Paleontology Person! Welcome!"

        Add a scenario that represents this, and compare your answer
        to ours. The most important thing is that you're using natural
        language.

            assertTrue: feature('registration.feature').hasScenarios()
            failure: I don't see *any* scenarios. Check your syntax on the scenario
        check_scenario_title:

            # @TODO Maybe start numering scenario from 1 instead of 0..? Not sure here
            assertFalse: feature('registration.feature').getScenario(1).getTitle() == ''

#        $steps = $scenario->getSteps();
#        $hasGiven = false;
#        $hasWhen = false;

#            } elseif ('Then' == $step->getType()) {
#                $hasThen = true;
#            }
#        }
        check_given:
            type: behat
            assertTrue: feature('registration.feature').getScenario(1).hasStep('Given')
            failure: I don't see a `Given` in your scenario: you probably want one to start on the "/" page
        check_when:
            type: behat
            assertTrue: feature('registration.feature').getScenario(1).hasStep('When')
            failure: I don't see a `When` in your scenario: you definitely need some, like for clicking Register, filling out the fields and pressing the submit button
        check_then:
            type: behat
            assertTrue: feature('registration.feature').getScenario(1).hasStep('Then')
            failure: I don't see a `Then` in your scenario: you probably want one where you check if the success message was shown

        Check out the following scenario. What's wrong here?

        ```gherkin
        Scenario: Sending a message
            Given there is a "dr_dino@example.com" user in the database
            And I am logged in as "dr_dino@example.com"
            And I am on "/"
            When I click "Send Message"
            And I fill in the message box with "Hello everyone!"
            And I press "Send"
            Then a message from "dr_dino@example.com" should be sent
        ```
    explanation: >
        In `Given`, you *can* "play god" and do things like database setup that your
        user cannot do. That's it's biggest purpose. But, it's also "ok" to take some
        user action - like logging in - when that user action really isn't central
        to what your scenario is really trying to do.

        The real problem is the `Then`: it is describing something that the user
        cannot see. What does it mean that the message "should be sent"? Unlike `Given`,
        we can't give the user super-powers here and allow them to "see" technical
        things, like messages being sent or database records being inserted.
    features:
        multiple_choice:
            choices:
                a: Actually, this scenario is perfect!
                b: In `Given`, you can only do things that the user can do. So, you can't magically "add a user to the database"
                c: In `Given`, you can't take user action. Saying "I am logged in as" implies that the user will go to the login page and login. This is user action and so should be under `When`.
                d: In `Then`, the user cannot see that a "message should be sent". The user would see some sort of a message, like "Your message has been sent" and we should look for this.
            correct: d
