    question: >
        You've assembled a crack team for a brand new project:
        a site where paleontologists and other dinosaur scientists
        can send each other important scientific messages, along
        with the usual cat photos.

        Each scientist will need to register to gain access, and
        you - knowing that using BDD will create a better product -
        are writing a registration feature. Fill in the 4 feature
        lines in `registration.feature`.
